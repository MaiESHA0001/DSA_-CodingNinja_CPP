/*
Problem statement
Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.

Note:
Fibonacci series is the series of numbers where each number is obtained by adding two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci series are 0 and 1.
